Most authors of compilers and interpreters spend undue time on syntax before even getting to semantics. Compiler textbooks tell you to do this! Semantics becomes a hidden \"implementation detail,\" but then developers forgive themselves for making an ungodly mess of it. We prefer the other way around. Get the semantics clean, composable, extendable, maintainable, and correct, _first_, then spend time on syntax, if you even care any more. Or just let someone else do it. From the compiler-development point of view, syntax is a distraction. It's been solved for decades, but it makes young developers and professors feel powerful. The decision to spend time on syntax before semantics is not engineering, it's self-indulgence."

Schemulator doesn't parse, [on purpose](#semantics), and [Python infamously avoids tail recursion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13591970/does-python-optimize-tail-recursion).

    "This is frighteningly consise, like all `call/cc` code, at first glance, but not too bad if explained: `LOOP3` takes user's domain code `d` and closes over it in the _generic_ recursive business code `P3` of three business parameters named (capriciously) `m`, `c`, `x`. The recursive business code `P3` is passed to the domain code `d`. If `(d P3)` calls `P3`, as it should do in the recursive case, then `P3` recurses unconditionally by calling the continuation `k`. Otherwise, in the base case of its recursion, `(d P3)` doesn't call `P3` and `P3` just returns the result of `(d P3)` applied to actual-argument values for `m`, `c`, and `x`, 1, 1, and 6 in this case."
